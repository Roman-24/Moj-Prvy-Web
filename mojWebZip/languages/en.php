    At that time, the new iPhone X was completely out of line with the previously used shape of Apple phones and brought a frameless OLED display with a diagonal of 5.8\".
    This makes the iPhone X considerably smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. The control of such a large diagonal is thus quite famously and literally addictive.

    For a long time, I was of the opinion that it was useless, but once I got them, I never want to live without them again.
    Who has not yet understood AirPods are Apple's wireless headphones. What I have to emphasize their price is not so friendly though
    Apple is a premium brand so I got used to it and I have to say that in this case I do not regret the money spent at all.
    The headphones themselves last for about 4 hours. The sound is very cool due to the size of the device. Even better than wired
    version of headphones. The box can provide us with another 24h battery life.
