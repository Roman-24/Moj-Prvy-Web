# My First Website
This is my first website that I have ever created. The entire site is hand-coded from scratch.

The final version of the website includes the use of PHP to include headers and footers based on the current subpage. The project also features CSS animation for the menu, dynamic file loading via PHP for the photo gallery, and a simple form.
